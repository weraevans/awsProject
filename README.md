# awsProject

1. What does it do? Write a short sentence and list the working functionalities.

2. What is it? Clearly, indicate what that code is supposed to produce. Is it a web, desktop, mobile app or a library?

3. Technologies used:
-> Java
-> Mockito
-> AWS:
  - API Gateway
  - Lambda
  - DynamoDB
  - S3

4. What is the ambition of the project? Are you just test-driving a technology or is it something that is or will go live somewhere?

5. What is the stage of the project? Clearly, indicate where you are with it. Whether it is complete or a work in progress? If it's a work in progress indicate what is done and what is pending.

6. Are there some known issues or things that are not properly done? If yes list them because I'll be much more tolerant when/if I find shortcomings that have been highlighted than if I just discover them myself.
